                        How much time to address this issue: A day or less, a few days a week, < 6 months, > 6 months
                        Severity of Hazard address (i for help): 
                            First Aid: no recovery required before returning to job: Bruising, small cuts, no loss time, doesn't require attention by medical doctor
                            Reversible Injury: Normally reversible; likely will return to same job after recovery from incident: broken bones, severe lasceration, short hospitalization, short term disability, lost time (multi-day), fingertip amputation (not thumb)

                            slightly reduced: PPE and Administrative controlled- Worker still responsible for compliance
                            Modestly reduced: Engineering controlled - worker is prevented from contacting hazard
                            Eliminated: Substitution or elimination of hazard
                        Difficulty to complete: easy, average, difficult, help
                            "Easy" - Most work can be done from the comfort of the desk chair A few forms need filled out or written Little to no collaboration is needed.
                            "Average" - Collaboration is needed. The creation of new procedures or processes. 
                            "Difficult" - "Blood, sweat, and tears" are needed to complete. The implementation of brand new ideas. Challenging the status quo
